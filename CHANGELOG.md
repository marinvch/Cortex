# Changelog

All notable changes to Cortex. Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com);
this project now versions independently of any package manager (see `VERSION`).

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-01

**Live MCP brain + team engine + plugin bundle.**

### Added
- **Live MCP brain** — `mcp/` Node server with `recall`, `get_project_context`, `list_projects`, and `capture` tools; security path-jail; one-line user-scope registration via `/connect-brain`.
- **Team context engine** — team-brain git sync (append-only, one-file-per-note, auto commit+push), generic `.cortex/connector.json`, `ai-os team init|add` (`/team-init`, `/team-add`).
- **Capture sources** — `ai-os digest` (read-only git/PR digest into brain notes).
- **Holiday catch-up** — `catch_me_up` MCP tool + `ai-os catch-up` (`/catch-me-up`).
- **Cortex Core Plugin Bundle** — committed manifest + `.claude/settings.json` stamping (Core tier out-of-the-box) + `ai-os setup-plugins` offering optional tiers by role.

### Resolved
- **#305**, **#306**.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-30

First stable **plain-files, bash-only** release. The vault and all tooling run with nothing but
bash — no Node, no Python, no engine. **Breaking:** the Node installer is retired.

### Added
- **Unified viewer app** — `bash tools/cortex.sh` builds and opens `cortex.html`: one self-contained
  page with four tabs — **Map** (Obsidian-style force graph), **Notes** (rendered markdown with
  clickable `[[wikilinks]]` and a 🗑 Remove button), **Repos** (registered codebases), **Gaps**
  (orphan notes + dead links). No server, no runtime.
- **Nested scoped briefs** — `/scope-area` adds a deep `AGENTS.md` leaf inside a critical directory
  plus an Area-map routing table in root, so agents load narrow, high-signal context.
- **`/migrate-engine`** — harvests an old engine's memory store into `AGENTS.md` *before* removing
  the old files, so no knowledge is lost across the breaking change.
- **`/analyze-spec`** — Spec-Driven Development grounded by the brain (Cortex context + Superpowers
  workflow).
- **`/reindex`** + `templates/moc.md` — keep the vault navigable as it grows (regenerate the viewer,
  nominate Maps of Content, resolve dead links).
- **Skill suggestion** and **old-engine detection** in `cortex-init.sh` and `/install-project`.
- **`.cortexignore`** — single source of truth for what *isn't* knowledge, shared by every generator
  via `tools/_cortex-lib.sh` (no per-script drift).
- **`cortex-rm.sh`** + in-UI Remove button — archive a note and de-link inbound references safely.
- **`--register-to-vault`** cross-repo registration; the Repos tab lists registered codebases.

### Changed
- Installer rewritten in **pure bash** (`tools/cortex-init.sh`) — zero runtime deps; works in
  git-bash, zsh, WSL, Linux, macOS.
- CI is now a **bash smoke test** (dropped the Node/bun matrix).
- Navigation model: **Maps of Content + links**, not deep folders.
- README rewritten with clear, step-by-step usage (including "use it on your other projects").

### Removed
- Node installer `cortex-init.mjs` → `archives/cortex-init.mjs.legacy`; both `package.json` files
  archived.
- Duplicate generators `cortex-nav.sh` / `cortex-brain.sh` → consolidated into `cortex.sh`.
- Stale `.vscode/*.chatprompt.md` old-engine leftovers and superseded static views → archived.

### Fixed
- **Graph noise** that looked like vault gaps: only genuine knowledge files are shown (23 vs 51) and
  dead-link detection is honest — examples, templates, comments, and inline-code `[[...]]` no longer
  count. False-positive dead links: 0.

### Validated
- Local CI green (12/12): every script parses, the installer smoke test passes, all 12 skills have
  valid frontmatter, the GitHub Actions workflow is bash-only.
- Demonstrated end-to-end on a real repo (`ai_saas`): brain installed, old engine migrated (10
  verified memory facts harvested), nested briefs created for auth / webhooks / RAG.
